        ## INVEST Principles for User Stories:
        
        - **Independent**: Stories should not depend on other stories and can be implemented in any order
        - **Negotiable**: Stories are not detailed contracts; they're starting points for conversation
        - **Valuable**: Each story must deliver value to users or stakeholders
        - **Estimable**: Stories should be clear enough for developers to estimate effort
        - **Small**: Stories should fit within a single iteration/sprint
        - **Testable**: Stories should have clear acceptance criteria that can be verified
        
        ### Tips:
        - Keep the story focused on user value, not technical implementation
        - Use acceptance criteria to define "done"
        - Break down large stories (epics) into smaller, manageable stories
        - Ensure each story can be demonstrated to stakeholders
